Tasks Completed
Task 1: I changed the number of stars to be random between 50 and 300. Before, it was always 100 stars, but now it’s different every time you run the game
Task 2: I made each star rotate differently, with a random rotation between 0 and 1 radian. This makes the stars look more interesting because they’re not all facing the same way.
Task 3: I added random transparency to each star, between 0.25 and 1. This makes some stars look brighter and others more faded.
Task 4: I gave each star a random size between 0.25 and 1. Now the stars are different sizes, which looks cooler.
Task 5: I made each star a random color. Before, they were all the same color, but now they’re all different colors, which makes the background more fun to look at.
